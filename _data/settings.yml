  We believe security is for anyone who wants to learn and center our activities around multiple aspects of security.
  This includes live individual and team-based competitions, hands-on training, student run research, and sponsor talks.
  Our security exercises cover a wide variety of areas in computing security, including penetration testing,
  Windows and Linux server hardening,
  web security, network services, and more!

  - name: NextHop
    meeting_time: "See workplace for details!"
    description: >-
      NextHop is an interest group focused on exploring full stack network and systems security, administration, and implementation within the real world. 
      By looking at business infrastructures as a whole, we can better observe and understand how information moves across networks and applications, 
      and how different services and technologies are used to create secure computing environments. 
      Our interactive learning community is built on providing students access to ecosystems that mirror industry standard setups, 
      that might otherwise be difficult to gain exposure to. Our Community Build-It and Hack-It Nights will provide such experiences, 
      focusing on building up, and tearing into an implementation of relevant topics of the communities choosing. 
      Students of any level are welcome to all events, we never expect preexisting skills other than a willingness to try and figure new things out. 
      In addition to meetings throughout the year, NextHop runs a competition, 
      NSIC - Networking & Systems Infrastructure Competition, 
      which will hopefully still occur in the coming spring. 
    leader: Ali Amari and Andrew Alfonso

      Feb 28 - March 1st 2020. The Information Security Talent Search is an annual three-day cyber
      attack/defend competition typically hosted in the early spring at RIT.
      Every year, competitors from both RIT and invited colleges from around the
      country are faced with a wide variety of challenges which are designed to
      cover as many facets of the security industry as possible. This includes
      defensive and offensive capabilities, system administration, software
      security, networking, programming, and much more! Challenges and activities
      include a CTF, King-of-the-Hill, policy writing, incident response, and
      code review -- all while defending a completely student-built
      infrastructure!
